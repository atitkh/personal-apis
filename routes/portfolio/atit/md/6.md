## Introduction

**Car Refuel** is an Augmented Reality (AR) game designed specifically for [Snapchat's AR glasses](https://www.spectacles.com/?lang=en-US). This interactive lens allows players to control and refuel a virtual car by collecting fuel cans scattered around their real-world environment. By blending AR technology with engaging gameplay mechanics, the project offers a unique and immersive experience for users.

## Project Overview

**Car Refuel** leverages Snap's Lens Studio to create a game that is both entertaining and innovative. The lens features two distinct game modes, intuitive touch controls optimized for AR glasses, and dynamic elements like random fuel can spawning and a scoring system to keep players engaged.
