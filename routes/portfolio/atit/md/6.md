## Introduction

This interactive web application leverages Streamlit to provide a comprehensive and visual exploration of GPT-2's transformer architecture. By breaking down each layer and its components, users can gain an in-depth understanding of how GPT-2 processes and generates text.

Whether you're a student, researcher, or AI enthusiast, this tool is designed to demystify the complexities of transformer models, making them accessible and engaging through intuitive visualizations.

## Features

- **Tokenization Visualization:** Input any text and see how GPT-2 tokenizes it into tokens and assigns token IDs. You can also the model's all tokens and their IDs to a CSV file for further analysis.    
- **Embeddings Exploration:** Visualize token and position embeddings, along with their combined representations using tables and heatmaps. You can also view the embeddings in 3D space using PCA to understand their relationships.
- **Transformer Layer Breakdown:** Dive deep into each transformer layer, exploring layer normalization, multi-head self-attention, residual connections, and the feed-forward neural network (MLP) with their weights and biases, as well as intermediate outputs.
- **Text Generation Control:** Adjust parameters such as Temperature, Top-K, Top-P, to influence the text generation process and reduce repetition.
- **Generated Text Display:** Generate text based on input and visualize the generation steps, including token probabilities and selection processes.
