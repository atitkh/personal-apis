## Overview

The **AR Business Card** is a a project I worked on to showcase how augmented reality can transform traditional business practices by making business cards more interactive, dynamic, and engaging. The project uses MindAR for marker tracking and A-Frame for AR rendering, allowing users to scan a business card and view digital content such as contact details, social media links, and animations overlaid on the card. The AR elements are interactive, enabling users to click on icons to open websites or contact information, creating an immersive and engaging digital interface.

## Inspiration

As the founder of an XR startup, I sought to explore how augmented reality could enhance traditional marketing tools like business cards. By creating an AR business card for our company, [Kerkar Creations](https://kerkarcreations.com), we aimed to provide a unique and interactive way for individuals and businesses to share contact information and engage with potential clients or partners. This project was inspired by the growing interest in AR technology and our desire to showcase its capabilities in a practical and accessible format as we prepared to launch our business cards.

## How It Works

- Users **scan a QR Code** on the back of the business card to open the AR experience on their mobile device or desktop browser.
- A prompt appears to allow camera access, and users can **point their device** at the business card to view the AR content.
- The AR content includes **interactive elements** like buttons for social media links, email, phone number, and website, providing a seamless way to access additional information.
- **Video overlays, 3D models, and animations** can be displayed on the business card, creating a dynamic and engaging user experience.

## Technical Implementation

- **MindAR**: MindAR enables image recognition and tracking of the business card, ensuring precise and stable AR overlays. This allows the AR content to remain fixed on the card as the user moves the device.
- **A-Frame**: A-Frameâ€™s lightweight and responsive framework is used to support AR and 3D rendering.

## Challenges Faced

- **Stable Tracking**: Achieving stable tracking of the business card to prevent jittery or misplaced AR elements required fine-tuning the MindAR settings.
- **Portfolio Videos**: Integrating video overlays on the business card while maintaining optimal performance and quality was a challenge due to file size and loading times.

## Future Enhancements

- **Customizable Templates**: Developing a platform where users can design their own AR experiences be it for business cards, brochures, or other marketing materials with pre-built templates.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how augmented reality can transform traditional business practices by making business cards more interactive, dynamic, and engaging. It offers a unique and memorable way for individuals and businesses to present information in a cutting-edge format.
