## Overview

The GuitAR Tutor is an innovative augmented reality lens designed to assist beginner guitar players in learning chords interactively and intuitively. The lens leverages AR technology to visualize finger positions on the guitar’s frets, providing real - time guidance on chord placement. The goal was to create a fun and engaging learning experience that enhances the traditional method of learning guitar chords.



## Hackathon

This project was one of the winners of the [Snap AR Lensathon 2023](https://devpost.com/software/guitar-tutor), a hackathon organized by Snap Inc. to encourage developers to create innovative AR experiences using Lens Studio.



## Team Members

This project was developed by a team of three members from [Kerkar Creations](https://kerkarcreations.com), each contributing their unique skills and expertise to create the GuitAR Tutor lens.

## Inspiration

The idea for the GuitAR Tutor emerged during a casual jam session with friends, where we identified the need for a more interactive way to learn guitar chords. Traditional learning methods can be challenging for beginners, as they often involve interpreting static chord diagrams and transferring this information onto the guitar. By using AR, we aimed to bridge this gap, providing users with an intuitive and engaging tool to visualize chord positions directly on their guitars.  

## Key Features

-  **Interactive Chord Visualization**: Users can see finger positions for various chords directly overlaid on the guitar neck.

-  **VoiceML Integration**: Users can change chords by voice command, enhancing ease of use.

-  **Chords Carousel**: A user - friendly carousel feature allows easy selection of different chords from A to G.



## How It Works

-  **Image Marker Tracking**: The system uses a printed image marker placed on the guitar’s body to track the instrument's position and orientation. Once the marker is detected, it serves as a reference point for mapping the guitar’s neck and frets.

-  **Manual Calibration**: Users manually set the positions for the nut and the first fret using control buttons, allowing the system to calculate the positions of all other frets and strings.

-  **Chord Mapping**: After calibration, the lens maps the finger positions for various chords onto the guitar neck, displaying them in real - time to guide the user’s finger placement.



## Technical Implementation

-  **AR Platform**: Developed using Snap’s Lens Studio, leveraging its AR capabilities to track objects in 3D space and overlay interactive elements.

-  **Marker Design**: The image marker was designed symmetrically along one axis to minimize tracking errors caused by camera mirroring. This design choice ensured more reliable detection regardless of camera orientation.

-  **Mathematical Calculations**: The system uses geometric calculations to determine fret and string positions based on the initial calibration inputs. By measuring the width of the first fret and height of the strings, it dynamically adjusts to various guitar sizes without relying on machine learning.

-  **VoiceML**: Integrated VoiceML capabilities allow the user to switch chords by voice commands, enhancing the hands - free experience and making the learning process smoother.



## Challenges Faced

-  **Fret Detection Accuracy**: Accurately detecting all frets and string positions for different guitar sizes posed a significant challenge. Ideally, machine learning would handle this, but we opted for a mathematical approach due to resource constraints.

-  **Camera Mirroring Effects**: Using front and back cameras for tracking introduced potential inaccuracies due to mirroring. To address this, the marker was designed to be symmetric, allowing consistent tracking regardless of which camera was used.

-  **User Calibration**: Ensuring user - friendly and precise calibration of the guitar’s nut and first fret was essential for accurate chord mapping. This step required careful interface design to make the process straightforward for beginners.



## What We Learned

We gained a deeper understanding of guitar anatomy, which was crucial for designing a realistic and accurate AR experience. Knowledge of the instrument’s proportions directly influenced the tracking and visualization algorithms. This project reinforced the importance of user - centric design in AR applications, particularly when creating educational tools. Simplicity, accuracy, and ease of use were critical factors in ensuring the lens was effective and engaging. Striking a balance between innovative technology and user accessibility was a key takeaway. By opting for a simpler marker - based tracking method, we were able to deliver a robust AR experience without overwhelming the user.



## Future Enhancements

-  **Machine Learning Integration**: Future versions of the lens could explore integrating machine learning to automate fret and string detection, eliminating the need for manual calibration.

-  **Expanded Chord Library**: It is also possible to expand the chord library and include more complex chords, as well as adding strumming patterns to guide users in playing specific songs.

-  **Multi-Instrument Support**: Building on the success of the Guitar Tutor, similar AR educational tools for other instruments like piano and drums could be developed.

-  **Next Gen Spectacles Integration**: Exploring advanced AR glasses like Snap’s Next Gen Spectacles could provide a more immersive and hands-free learning experience.



## Conclusion

The GuitAR Tutor lens demonstrates how augmented reality can transform traditional learning methods, making guitar practice more interactive, fun, and accessible. By leveraging AR technology and thoughtful design, we created a tool that not only teaches chord placement but also enhances user engagement and learning efficiency. This project highlights the potential of AR in educational contexts and sets the stage for future innovations in music learning.
