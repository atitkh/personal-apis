## Introduction

**Bull Hand** is an Augmented Reality (AR) experience I developed to celebrate the famous **San Fermin Festival** in Pamplona, Spain. This lens transforms your hand into a bull using hand tracking technology, allowing users to engage with the festival's spirit in a fun and interactive way.

## Project Overview

The San Fermin Festival is renowned for its "Running of the Bulls," a tradition that attracts visitors from all over the world. Inspired by this event, I wanted to create an AR experience that captures the essence of the festival while providing a unique way for people to participate virtually.

## Development Journey

### Concept and Design

The idea was to use hand tracking to turn a user's hand into a bull's head when they made a specific gestureâ€”the "rock on" sign (ðŸ¤˜). I used a 3D hand model and applied the bull's features onto it with **Substance 3D Painter**.

The index and little fingers were painted, resembling horns when extended. To add detail, I painted the eyes and nose on the back of the middle and ring fingers, which are seen when the fingers are closed. This creates the illusion of a bull's face when the user makes the gesture.

### Technical Implementation

- **Hand Tracking**: Utilized Lens Studio's hand tracking capabilities to accurately map the 3D hand model onto the user's real hand.

## Learnings

Developing **Bull Hand** was a fascinating exploration into the possibilities of hand tracking in AR. I gained valuable experience in:

- **Creative 3D Texturing**: Improved my skills in **Substance 3D Painter** to create textures.
- **User Interaction Design**: Learned how to design intuitive and engaging interactions that enhance user experience.

## Conclusion

**Bull Hand** is a fun and interactive AR lens that brings a piece of the San Fermin Festival to users everywhere. By transforming a simple hand gesture into a dynamic AR experience, I wanted to capture the excitement and cultural significance of the event through artistic expression and technology.
