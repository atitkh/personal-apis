## Introduction

**Bakrid Mubarak** is an Augmented Reality (AR) game I created to celebrate **Eid al-Adha** (also known as Bakrid). This interactive Snapchat lens combines cultural significance with engaging gameplay, allowing users to feed a virtual sheep using hand tracking.

## Project Overview

Eid al-Adha is an important Islamic festival. A central part of the celebration involves the sacrifice of an animal, often a sheep, and sharing the meat with family, friends, and those in need. I wanted to create an AR experience that honors this tradition in a fun and respectful way, allowing users to interact and share the joy of the festival.

### Built With

## Development Journey

The idea was to use hand tracking to transform the user's hand into a sheep. When the user makes a fist gesture, their hand appears as a sheep with wool texture, a sheep's head image on the front (the middle of the fist), and two legs on the bottom. This creates an illusion of a cute sheep in the user's hand.

To make the game interactive, I incorporated falling grass from the top of the screen. The objective is to move the sheep (the user's hand) to catch and "eat" the grass before it falls off the screen. This simple yet engaging mechanic encourages users to participate and enjoy the experience.

I used **Substance 3D Painter** to create the sheep wool texture applied to the hand model. The textures were carefully crafted to align perfectly with the hand's contours when the fist gesture is made.

### Technical Implementation

- **Hand Tracking**: Utilized Lens Studio's hand tracking capabilities to detect the fist gesture and accurately map the sheep textures onto the user's hand.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Programmed the falling grass using JavaScript, creating a continuous stream of grass that the user needs to catch.
- **Collision Detection**: Added collision detection between the sheep and the grass to determine when the grass is eaten, increasing the user's score. Here, proper adjustments were essential because the sheep was positioned in world coordinates, while the grass was in screen coordinates.

## Conclusion

**Bakrid Mubarak** combines tradition with technology, offering a playful way to celebrate Eid al-Adha through augmented reality. By transforming users' hands into sheep and engaging them in a fun feeding game, the lens brings a touch of festivity and joy to the holiday.
