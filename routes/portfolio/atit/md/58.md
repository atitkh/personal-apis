## Overview

The **F1 Mixed Reality Simulation** is an immersive data-driven experience built in Unity that replays real Formula 1 races using live telemetry sourced from the OpenF1 API. Designed for both **VR HMD (Meta Quest 3)** and **large-scale environments like the CAVE**, this simulation visualizes race dynamics such as driver movement, leaderboard progression, sector performance, and on-track interactions. The project focuses on translating raw motorsport telemetry into an intuitive spatial experience for analysis, education, and engagement.

The system reconstructs race events in real time by animating 3D driver models on a calibrated track map while presenting contextual information through surrounding UI panels. Users can observe race flow, compare driver stats, and understand positional changes, all in an interactive mixed-reality environment.

## Inspiration

Formula 1 represents one of the richest real-time data ecosystems in sports. The motivation behind this project was to bring that data into an immersive environment where race evolution can be **felt**, not just read. Traditional timing sheets and broadcasts convey limited spatial intuition; this simulation bridges that gap by turning real telemetry into an explorable 3D scene.

The project also extends the user’s capacity to analyze race strategy, visualize overtakes, monitor gaps, and understand drivers’ changing positions through an engaging MR interface.

## How It Works

- The system retrieves **real race telemetry** (car positions, speeds, sector times, lap events, gaps) from the **OpenF1 API**.
- Unity reconstructs driver paths on a **2D-3D hybrid track**, updating in real time according to timestamp-synchronized data.
- Three major UI panels enhance spatial awareness:  
  - **Leaderboards** with live position changes  
  - **Telemetry panel** showing speed, RPM, gear, and sector deltas  
  - **Track map** with animated markers and relative positioning  
- The simulation can run on:  
  - **Quest 3 MR mode**, anchoring the race table onto real-world surfaces  
  - **A multi-wall CAVE**, distributing UI and visual elements across three surfaces  

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Integration
- Uses OpenF1 endpoints for driver state, lap times, GPS data, and sector splits.
- Converts raw timestamped updates into continuous motion using interpolation and smoothing.

### 2. Unity System Architecture
- Modular controllers handle car motion, UI updates, race progression, and event logging.
- A custom race manager synchronizes all telemetry streams to simulate real-time flow.
- Extensively optimized for both **VR and multi-display projection**.

### 3. MR / VR Adaptations
- Spatial anchoring for Quest 3 allows the track to appear on a physical desk or floor.
- UI orientation adapts to the user’s environment—flat wall UI in CAVE, floating UI in VR.

## Challenges Faced

- **Synchronizing telemetry** across multiple data categories required dynamic timestamp correction.
- **Smoothing car movement** while remaining faithful to real recorded data.
- **Optimizing UI readability** across vastly different environments (VR vs CAVE wall projections).
- Ensuring **performance stability** when rendering large amounts of real-time data.

## Future Enhancements

- **Lap-by-lap replay navigation** (scrubbing through race timeline).
- **Pit stop visualization**, including tire changes and delays.
- **Driver comparison mode** with side-by-side telemetry graphs.
- **Full 3D track extrusion** to simulate real circuits in volumetric space.
- **Integration with DataEcho** for XR-based gaze analytics and attention studies.

## Conclusion

The F1 Mixed Reality Simulation demonstrates how real motorsport telemetry can be reimagined into an interactive spatial experience. The project blends Unity, real-world data, and immersive technology to provide unique perspectives on race strategy, driver dynamics, and overall race flow. It is a foundational step toward richer XR sports analytics and educational visualizations.
