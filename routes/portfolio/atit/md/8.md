## Overview

I'm thrilled to share **AR Snooker**, a project that tries bringing the game of snooker right into your environment through Augmented Reality. Designed for Snapchat and compatible with [Snap's AR glasses](https://www.spectacles.com/?lang=en-US), this lens lets you set up a snooker table wherever you are and play the game in a realistic and interactive way.

## Development Journey

### Building the AR Snooker Table

The project spawns a snooker table in front of the user in AR. One of the key challenges was making the shooting mechanics intuitive and responsive. The shoot direction is calculated straight in front of your direction, wherever you move around the table. This means the white ball is always ready to be hit, and your position determines the angle of the shot. The force with which you hit the ball depends on how long you press and hold on the screen before releasing.

### Physics Simulation

When I was developing the game, Lens Studio had just released physics engine into their system but didn't have physics materials to properly simulate the bouncing of the balls when they collide with each other or with the walls of the table. So, I had to implement this part manually. When two balls collide, I calculated the new velocities and angle based on the collision point and the mass of the balls. This way, the balls move around the table in a realistic manner.

### Scoring System

To keep track of the game, I implemented a scoring system. When the numbered balls are pocketed into one of the holes on the table, you earn points. This is calculated through collision detection between the balls and the pockets. This part is not visualized yet.

## Challenges Faced

- **Manual Physics Implementation**: Without built-in physics materials in Lens Studio, I had to manually code the physics simulations to mimic real-world snooker dynamics, as only simulating the balls' movement with physics engine was not enough.
- **Intuitive Controls**: Designing a control system that felt natural in AR was challenging. I wanted players to move around the table and have the game respond accurately to their position and inputs but also be easy to understand and use.
- **Optimizing Performance**: Ensuring the game ran smoothly on both mobile devices and AR glasses was a priority. I had to optimize the code and assets to maintain a high frame rate and responsive gameplay.

## What I Learned

Working on **AR Snooker** was a fantastic learning experience. I gained deeper insights into:

- **Augmented Reality Design**: Creating an immersive AR experience requires careful consideration of user interaction and environment mapping.
- **Problem-Solving**: Overcoming the limitations of the development tools pushed me to find creative solutions.
- **Developing for AR Glasses**: Designing for Snap's AR glasses required me to optimize the game for a different platform and user experience.

## Future Enhancements

- **Scoring**: Scoring mechanism is currently only in code; I plan to add a visual score display on the table.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Adding the ability to play with friends in real-time.
- **Enhanced Graphics**: Improving the visual quality of the table and balls.
- **Tutorial Mode**: Including a guided tutorial to help new players understand the controls and gameplay.
