## Introduction

I'm excited to share **Mask Cleanup**, an augmented reality (AR) experience that encourages users to clean up virtual masks littered around their environment and dispose of them properly in a virtual bin. This project was developed as part of the [Snap AR Lensathon 2020](https://ar.snap.com/lens-fest-snaps-global-ar-festival?lang=en-US), and I'm proud to say that our team comprising me, [Danny Marree](https://linktr.ee/dannymarree), and [Gera Fine](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/creator/RDiIUNGCsDazCbwMYyN76w)â€”was among the winners.

## Overview

During the height of the pandemic, discarded masks became an environmental concern, littering streets and natural spaces. We wanted to address this issue by creating an interactive experience that not only raises awareness but also promotes proper disposal habits in a fun and engaging way. By utilizing AR technology, **Mask Cleanup** allows users to visualize the impact of littering and take action within a virtual space. When using front camera, the user can also wear a mask to see animated instructions overlayed on the mask using mask segmentation.

### Built With

![Blender](https://img.shields.io/badge/Blender-F5792A?style=for-the-badge&logo=blender&logoColor=white)
![Adobe Photoshop](https://img.shields.io/badge/Adobe%20Photoshop-31A8FF?style=for-the-badge&logo=adobe%20photoshop&logoColor=white)

## How It Works

When you activate the lens, virtual masks appear scattered on the ground around you. Your mission is to clean up by tapping on the masks to collect them. Once you've gathered the masks, you can dispose of them in a virtual bin that appears in the AR environment. The lens keeps track of how many masks you've cleaned up, adding a gamified element to the experience.

## Features

- **Mask Segmentation**: Overlay animated instructions on a real mask when using the front camera.
- **Interactive AR**: Masks are randomly placed in your surroundings, creating a realistic cleanup scenario.
- **Virtual Bin Disposal**: Dispose of collected masks into a virtual bin to complete the cleanup process.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep count of the masks you've cleaned up to challenge yourself or compete with friends.

## Development Journey

Here's a brief overview of our development process:

- **Concept Development**: We brainstormed ideas that combined AR technology with a meaningful message, settling on the theme of environmental cleanup.
- **Design and Modeling**: Using Blender and Adobe Photoshop, we created 3D models of masks and the disposal bin to use within the lens.
- **Programming**: Implemented interactive elements and user interactions using JavaScript in Lens Studio.

## What We Learned

- **The Power of AR for Social Impact**: AR can be a compelling medium for raising awareness and encouraging positive behavior.
- **Team Collaboration**: Leveraging each team member's strengths leads to a more polished and effective final product.
- **Technical Skills**: Improved our proficiency with Lens Studio, 3D modeling, and interactive programming.

## Conclusion

**Mask Cleanup** is more than just an AR experience; it's a call to action to be mindful of our environment. By transforming the simple act of picking up litter into an engaging game, we hope to inspire real-world behavior change.
