## Introduction

I'm excited to share one of my passion projects, **American Sign Language (ASL) lens** designed to make learning ASL more accessible and engaging. ASL is an incredible means of communication, especially for people with hearing impairments in the USA and Canada. I've always been captivated by how individuals can convey so much using just their hand gestures. This fascination inspired me to create a tool that could help others learn ASL in a fun and interactive way.

## Inspiration Behind the Project

My journey with ASL began when I learned basic signs like "I love you", "Hello", and a few other phrases. I also took on the challenge of spelling my name using fingerspelling, a technique where each letter of a word is signed individually. However, I found it challenging to memorize and practice the signs consistently. I realized that many others might face similar hurdles, and I wanted to create something that would simplify the learning process.

## Development Journey

In 2021, Snap Inc.'s Lens Studio introduced an improved hand tracking feature, including joint tracking for fingers. This was a game-changer for my idea. I envisioned using this technology to recognize ASL hand gestures by capturing the joint positions of the fingers for each sign.

### Building the ASL Lens

I dove into developing the lens immediately. By mapping the joint positions, the lens became capable of detecting almost all the signs of the English alphabet in ASL. It was thrilling to see the technology recognize the subtle nuances of each gesture.

However, I soon realized that while the lens was effective at detecting hand signs, it wasn't entirely user-friendly as a learning tool. Users needed more guidance and resources to practice and memorize the signs effectively.

### Integrating with a Website

The turning point came when SnapAR released **Camera Kit for Web**. This allowed me to integrate the [lens](https://lens.snapchat.com/17e9115780384a2288fe14f54d7e1b54) into a [website](https://asl.atitkharel.com.np), making it a more comprehensive learning platform. With the website, I could add additional content and features to enhance the user experience.

## Features of the ASL Learning Website

### User-Friendly Interface

I aimed for a simple yet effective layout to ensure that users could focus on learning without distractions. The website features:

- **Camera Canvas (Left Side)**: Users can practice hand signs in real-time using their device's camera.
- **Cheat Sheet (Right Side)**: Offers a visual guide to the ASL signs for all English alphabet letters.

### Interactive Search Functionality

To make fingerspelling easier, I added a search bar within the cheat sheet. Users can type any word, and the website will display the corresponding ASL signs for each letter. This dynamic feature allows users to practice fingerspelling and learn new words.

### Enhanced Learning Experience

By integrating the lens with the website, users receive immediate feedback on their gestures. This real-time interaction helps reinforce learning and makes the process more engaging.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expanded Vocabulary**: Incorporating signs for common phrases and words to go beyond just the alphabet.
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Adding guided lessons to help users learn ASL in a structured manner.
- **Progress Tracking**: Allowing users to monitor their learning journey and set personal goals.

## Conclusion

Creating the ASL lens and integrating it into a learning platform has been an incredibly rewarding experience. My goal is to make learning ASL more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. Whether you're just curious or have a personal reason to learn sign language, I hope this tool serves as a helpful resource on your journey.

I encourage you all to give it a tryâ€”maybe start by learning how to fingerspell your own name in ASL!
