## Introduction

**SL Lion** and **BD Tiger** are two Augmented Reality (AR) lenses developed in collaboration with **Rakuten Viber** to celebrate Sri Lanka's and Bangladesh's participation in the **T20 Cricket World Cup**. These projects transform users into a majestic lion and a fierce tiger—the national symbols of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh—allowing fans to show their support for their cricket teams in a fun and interactive way.

## Project Overview

Cricket is more than just a sport in both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh; it's a unifying force that brings entire nations together. With the T20 World Cup generating excitement across the globe, we wanted to create AR experiences that would resonate with fans and enhance their engagement during the tournament. The **SL Lion** and **BD Tiger** lenses do just that by overlaying detailed 3D animal heads onto the user's face, embodying the spirit and pride of each country.

These projects were collaborations with **Rakuten Viber**, integrating the lenses into their [AR Camera](https://www.forbusiness.viber.com/en/blog/post/rakuten-viber-snap-partnership/) feature. Viber, being a widely used messaging app in both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, provided the perfect platform to reach a large audience of cricket enthusiasts. Working closely with their team, we ensured that the lenses were optimized for Viber's AR capabilities while maintaining high-quality visuals and performance.

## Development

### Concept and Design

Our goal was to create AR lenses that were visually captivating and culturally significant. The lion and tiger are prominent symbols in the national identities of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, representing bravery, strength, and pride. By allowing users to transform into these animals, we aimed to evoke national pride and unity during the World Cup.

Using **Blender** and **Substance Painter**, we crafted 3D models of a lion's head and a tiger's head. Face morphing techniques were employed to ensure that the animal models seamlessly transformed and matched the user's facial movements, enhancing the realism and interactivity of the lenses.

### Technical Implementation

- **Face Morphing**: Implemented blendshapes to enable the animal models to appear dynamically, triggered by user opening their mouth.
- **Facial Tracking**: Utilized Lens Studio's advanced facial tracking to ensure the lion and tiger heads accurately followed the user's head movements and expressions.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized 3D assets to run smoothly on various devices without compromising visual quality.
- **Integration with Viber**: Collaborated with Rakuten Viber's team to integrate the lenses into their [AR Camera](https://www.forbusiness.viber.com/en/blog/post/rakuten-viber-snap-partnership/) feature, ensuring compatibility and a seamless user experience.

## Learnings

Working on the **SL Lion** and **BD Tiger** lenses was a valuable experience in collaborative development and cross-platform integration using Camera Kit. Collaborating with Rakuten Viber provided insights into adapting AR content for different platforms and audiences. Additionally, we enhanced our skills in 3D model optimization and performance tuning for mobile AR applications.

## Conclusion

Creating the **SL Lion** and **BD Tiger** AR lenses was a fulfilling project that combined technology, artistry, and cultural expression. By allowing users to embody the spirit of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh through augmented reality, we added a new dimension to how fans engage with sporting events. These lenses not only provided entertainment but also strengthened the sense of community and national pride among users.
