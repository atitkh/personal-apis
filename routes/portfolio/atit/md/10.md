## Introduction

**KEC Daily Routine** is an Augmented Reality (AR) experience that brings static posters to life. This project was developed to promote the [KEC Daily Routine App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halo.kecroutine&hl=en_US), an application designed for the students and faculty of Kathmandu Engineering College (KEC), developed by [Karun Shrestha](https://portfolio.karunshrestha.com.np/). By using image tracking technology, the lens animates the app's poster, revealing additional details like app features and notification previews that aren't visible on the physical poster.

## Project Overview

The main goal was to create an engaging way to showcase the app's capabilities beyond what a traditional poster could convey. By scanning the poster with the Snapchat lens, users unlock a dynamic AR experience that provides deeper insights into the app, making the promotional material more interactive and informative. The posters were displayed around the college campus to attract students and faculty to try out the AR lens and download the app.
